# Locomotive
A PHP command line app providing scheduled, aggressive, mirrored file fetching
using segmented and parallel transfers.

**Locomotive** is intended to be run as a repeated, scheduled job (ie: crontab), and
depends on successive runs to handle the moving of transfered items, LFTP queue monitoring,
and other necessary tasks. The suggested run interval is *ten minutes*, but may be run more
or less often depending on the user's needs.

Requirements
------------

* Linux or MacOS
* PHP >= v5.6.14
* [SSH2 Extension](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ssh2.php) >= v0.13
  * With [libssh2](https://www.libssh2.org) >= v1.4.3
* [SQLite3 Extension](http://php.net/manual/en/book.sqlite3.php)
* [LFTP](http://lftp.yar.ru) (tested with version v4.4.13)

Installation
------------

1. Make sure to have installed [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) globally on
your system.
2. Clone **Locomotive** to your machine. A couple good locations are your user
directory (`~/`) or somewhere in `/usr/local`.
3. Change to your **Locomotive** installation directory and install its
dependencies: `$ composer -v install --no-dev`
4. Ensure the following directories are writable by the user that will be
running **Locomotive**:
  * `app/storage`
  * `app/storage/logs`
  * `app/storage/working`
5. Ensure **Locomotive** can be executed: `$ chmod u+x locomotive`
6. Get some information about **Locomotive**: `$ ./locomotive -h`

Configuration
-------------

Many options can be passed at the command line, but there are several that **must**
be set in a config file. Any options issued at the CLI take precedence over
config file settings.

**Locomotive** looks for configuraiton files in YAML format in the following
locations, ordered by precedence:

1. `~/.locomotive`
2. `config.yml`
3. `app/default-config.yml`

Storing the **Locomotive** config file at `~/.locomotive` is ideal, as it will
be preserved through any upgrades or re-installations. Simply copy the default
config file and customize as needed.

### Config File Options

* **lftp-path** - Absolute path to Lftp.
* **private-keyfile** - Absolute path to your private key file that may be used for SSH connections to the host.
* **public-keyfile** - Absolute path to your public key file that may be used for SSH connections to the host.
* **username** - Username used to establish SSH connections to the host.
* **password** - Password used to establish SSH connections to the host (not necessary if key files are provided).
* **working-dir** - Absolute path to a custom working directory (overrides default location).
* **speed-limit** - Global speed limit for transfers in bytes (default is *unlimited*).
* **connection-limit** - Per-item transfer connection limit (default is *25*).
* **transfer-limit** - Global concurrent item transfer limit (defaults to *5*).
* **max-retries** - Maximum retry attempts for a failed or interrupted transfer.
* **newer-than** - A date/time cutoff expressed as a string that can be parsed by [`strtotime()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php).
* **zip-sources** - `true` or `false`; If set to `true`, items from multiple sources will be "zipped" together in alternating fashion to prevent any source(s) from claiming priority of `transfer-limit`.
* **remove-sources**
  * **remove** - `true` or `false`; If set to `true`, items will be removed from the host source after succesfully completing.
  * **exclude** - Any source paths to be excluded from removal expressed as a [YAML Sequence Collection](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html#collections).
* **speed-schedule** - The global speed limits may be scheduled for hours of the day by providing a [YAML Mapping Collection](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html#collections).
  * You may specify as many mappings as you want.
  * The times must be expressed in a format that can be parsed by [`strtotime()`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php).
  * The speed limit should be expressed in bytes.
  * Example: `"03:00-06:00": 51200`
* **source-target-map** - Although the source and target may be provided as command line arguments, multiple source/target relationships should be specified here as [YAML Mapping Collections](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html#collections).
  * Example: `"/absolute/path/to/source": "/absolute/path/to/target"`
* **post-processors** - If post-processing scripts are provided, they will be called in the order they are listed here with a single argument: the absolute path to the finished, moved item. Scripts should be expressed as a [YAML Sequence Collection](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html#collections).
  * Example: `- "/usr/local/bin/unrarall"` will be called as `/usr/local/bin/unrarall /path/to/item`.

**Locomotive** uses an intermediate location for working with the transfers it
initiates. By default, the working directory is located at `app/storage/working`,
but it may be a good idea to change the working directory, depending on the
size of the items **Locomotive** will transfering. Just make sure the working
directory is set as an absolute path, and is writable.
